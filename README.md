Creature Slayers is a Turn Based Web Browser game where you hunt down creatures for a bounty. Selecting their cards or passing ends the turn and starts the next one. The players actions always execute first before the creature meaning you get the first move.
The Slayers have coins that they can use to purchase cards to use for slaying creatures. After every turn the slayer gets +1 coin. Every Slayer is unique in some way.

The game was built in javascript, HTML, and CSS.
